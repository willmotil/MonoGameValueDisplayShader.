# MonoGameValueDisplayShader.
This is a shader for monogame that basically displays a value on the shader without a font.
The shader is pretty big with quite a few branches so don't be suprised if it takes a bit to compile.

There is also a line point and circle outline drawing function as well. 
Also included is a simple 2d refraction shader included in the shader example.
