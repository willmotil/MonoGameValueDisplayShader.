# MonoGameValueDisplayShader.
This is a shader for monogame that displays values on the shader without a font.
i.e. it algorithmically draws them.

The shader is pretty big with quite a few branches so don't be suprised if it takes a bit to compile.
There is also line, point and circle outline drawing functions as well. 
Also included is a simple 2d refraction shader.

In the below image the mouse position is sent to the shader and its values are displayed by the function
